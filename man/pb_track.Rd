\description{
Track data files of a given pattern or location
}
\details{
Note: tracked patterns are simply written to \code{.pbattributes}
(analogous to \code{.gitattributes} in \code{git-lfs}.)  You can also edit this
file manually.  You will probably want to check in \code{.psattributes} to
as to version control., with \code{git add .psattributes}.  Note that
tracked file patterns will also be added to \code{.gitignore}.
